1) Either the circle's centre lies inside the rectangle, or
2) One of the edges of the rectangle intersects the circle.

It is easy to compute condition 1.
For condition 2, compute the intersection point (P1 and P2) of 
the extended line of each edge (AB) with the circle, if segment  
AB and P1P2 has overlap, then this edge overlap or completely contained
in the circle.

==========================

2) rectangle and rectangle If the rectangle are axially aligned, 
see the projection of the two rectangle on each of the axial.

==================
3) if two rect are not axially parallelized, then we can test
each of the eight edges.
for edge E1 in rect1, if all points of rec2 lies in one side of
E1, and other points of rect1 lies in another side, then this edge
is a separating line.
this method can also be used to check the overlap relation of any two
vertex polygon other than rects.
