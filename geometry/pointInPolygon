If it is convex, a trivial way to check it is that the point is laying on the same side of 
all the segments (if traversed in the same order).
You can check that easily with the cross product (as it is proportional to the cosine of 
the angle formed between the segment and the point, 
those with positive sign would lay on the right side and those with negative sign on the left side).

if it is not convex, the Ray casting algorithm can be applied.
